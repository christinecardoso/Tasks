Start making UGC Style videos with the products you love in your home. 

Go to TikTok Creator Studeio and learn from the high performing ads they highlight there. Then Go to Facbook Ad library for the niche you want to be in or products you want to receive and look for the air ads. I made about 10 videos to out into my portfolio. 

Make your portfolio using the free version of Canva. 

Then get on Twitter. The UGC community on there is on fire. I get jobs from connecting on their every week. hashtags to get gigs are #UGCforhire #UGCOpportunity #UGCCreators #UGCCommunity
